[.lead]
NetApp periodically updates the Cloud Manager platform and REST API to bring you new features, enhancements, and bug fixes.

[IMPORTANT]
We might decided to remove this topic and possibly the entire release notes section. Or maybe keep this page as a record of what's new at this doc site (and not what's new with the APIs themselves).
