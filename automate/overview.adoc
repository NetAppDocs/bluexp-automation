You can use the resources on this page to get started integrating Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP in your https://www.netapp.com/us/info/what-is-infrastructure-as-code-iac.aspx[Infrastructure as Code^] (IaC) strategy and environment.

DevOps teams use a variety of tools to automate the creation and administration of data center runtime environments, including Terraform and Ansible. NetApp has developed a Terraform provider that you can use with Cloud Manager to automate and integrate Cloud Volumes ONTAP based on an IaC approach. See https://registry.terraform.io/providers/NetApp/netapp-cloudmanager/latest[Terraform provider: netapp-cloudmanager^] for more information.
