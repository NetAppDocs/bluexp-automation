=== HTTP methods

=== HTTP status codes

|Status code
|Reason Phrase
|Description
|`200`
|OK
|The request was completed successfully.
|`202`
|Accepted
|The request was accepted and is currently in process. BlueXP returns this code when the API call operates asynchronously. For example, the `/vsa/working-environments` call returns with 202 but the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance launches up to 25 minutes later.
|`204`
|No Content
|The operation was completed successfully and the server did not send a response message.
|`400`
|Bad Request
|The request input is not recognized or is inappropriate. An error response explains the reason.
|`401`
|Unauthorized
|The user has not authenticated.
|`403`
|Forbidden
|This operation is not allowed for the current authenticated user.
|`409`
|Conflict
|The operation failed because another operation is already in progress.
|`420`
|Method Failure
|BlueXP has not been set up. You must set up BlueXP using the API call `/occm/setup/init`
|`5xx`
|---
