[.lead]
You need to generate a bearer token to gain access to the Cloud Manager REST APIs. A user token is more commonly used for customer automation than the service token. There are two workflows available to create a user token. The one you select depends on your authentication environment.

[NOTE]
The first of the two workflows is *required* for federated authentication. However you can also use it for non-federated authentication. And because cleartext passwords are not used, it is the more secure way to authenticate and so is recommended for both federated and non-federated authentication.

== Create a user token with federated authentication

This workflow describes how to create a user access token when using federated authentication. You can also use it to create a user token for non-federated authentication which is recommended because of the enhanced security.

.Before you begin

Review the parameters in the JSON input example for the second workflow step.

=== 1. Generate a NetApp refresh token

Navigate to https://services.cloud.netapp.com/refresh-token[Refresh Token Generator^] and generate a long-lived token. You need to provide this in the `refresh_token` JSON input parameter in the next step.

=== 2. Generate the user token

This API call uses the _Auth0_ authentication service and not the NetApp Cloud Manager service. See the URL in the curl example below and adjust for your environment as needed. The client identifier in the JSON input is the same constant value for all customers.

|HTTP method
|Resource path
|POST

curl example::
[source,curl]
curl --location --request POST 'https://netapp-cloud-account.auth0.com/oauth/token' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --d @JSONinput

Input parameters::

The JSON input example includes the list of input parameters.

JSON input example::
[source,json]
{
    "grant_type": "refresh_token",
    "refresh_token": "<REFRESH_TOKEN>",
    "client_id": "Mu0V1ywgYteI6w1MbD15fKfVIUrNXGWC"
}

Output::

The JSON output example includes the list of returned values. The `expires_in` value is expressed in seconds.

JSON output example::
[source,json]
{
    "access_token": "<USER_TOKEN>",
    "id_token": "<ID_TOKEN>",
    "scope": "openid profile cc:update-password",
    "expires_in": 86400,
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}

== Create a user token with nonfederated authentication

This workflow describes how to create an access token when using non-federated authentication.

.Before you begin

Review the parameters in the JSON input example for the first workflow step. You must have the account credentials and the client identifier.

=== 1. Generate the user token

This API call uses the _Auth0_ authentication service and not the NetApp Cloud Manager service. See the URL in the curl example below and adjust for your environment as needed.

curl example::

curl --location --request POST 'https://netapp-cloud-account.auth0.com/oauth/token' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --d @JSONinput

Input parameters::

The JSON input example includes the list of input parameters.

JSON input example::
[source,json]
{
    "username": "user@my-company-demo.com",
    "scope": "openid profile",
    "audience": "https://api.cloud.netapp.com",
    "client_id": "<CLIENT_ID>",
    "grant_type": "password",
    "password": "userpassword",
    "Realm":"Username-Password-Authentication"
}

Output::

The JSON output example includes the list of returned values. The `expires_in` value is expressed in seconds.

JSON output example::
[source,json]
{
    "access_token": "<USER_TOKEN>",
    "id_token": "<ID_TOKEN>",
    "scope": "openid profile cc:update-password",
    "expires_in": 86400,
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}
