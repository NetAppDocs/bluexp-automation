[.lead]
You can access the BlueXP web user interface to retrieve the identifiers needed for the workflows.

[NOTE]
In addition to the BlueXP web user interface, you can also obtain the ID values through the Cloud Volumes ONTAP REST API. See link:../cm/wf_common_identity_get_supported_srv.html[Get supported services] for more information.

== Get the Connector identifier

Every Connector is assigned a unique identifier. You can retrieve the ID for a Connector and include it in the `x-agent-id` HTTP request header with each REST API call.

.Before you begin

You must have a BlueXP account. You created this account when you first logged in to BlueXP website and it’s displayed at the top of the BlueXP user interface. See link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/concept_cloud_central_accounts.html[Learn more about NetApp accounts^] for more information.

.Steps

. Navigate to the BlueXP website using a browser:
+
link:https://cloudmanager.netapp.com[https://cloudmanager.netapp.com^]

. Sign in using your BlueXP account credentials.

. Click *Connector* at the top right of the page and select *Manage Connectors*.

. On the *Manage Connectors* page, click the ellipses (...) icon.

. Select the *Connector ID*.
+
*Example*
`uzJbMFKEnuzi2ryLaENbCP52KBTXx0aIclients`

. You can optionally derive the associated client ID by removing the `clients` suffix. This ID applies when accessing the connector directly in _local mode_ and not through the SaaS interface.
+
*Example*
`uzJbMFKEnuzi2ryLaENbCP52KBTXx0aI`

.After you finish

You can use the Connector ID in the `x-agent-id` request header to properly route the request. See the curl examples in the workflows for more information.
