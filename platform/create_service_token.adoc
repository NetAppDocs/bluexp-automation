[.lead]
This workflow describes how to create a service access token that can be used by Cloud Manager internal services and external automation clients.

.Before you begin
You need to obtain the following:

 * `client_id`
 The application ID that the Cloud Manager SaaS UI has assigned to your application.

 * `client_secret`
 The secret generated by the UI when you registered the application.

See link:register_service.html[Register a service] for more information about obtaining these credentials.

=== 1. Generate the service token

This API call uses the *Auth0* authentication service and not a NetApp Cloud Manager service endpoint. You need to review the URL in the curl example and adjust for your environment as needed.
