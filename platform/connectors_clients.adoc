[.lead]
There are several additional identifiers you typically need depending on the grant type and REST API call.

=== Connector

A Connector is a type of agent deployed in the public cloud on behalf of a customer. It executes commands and other actions on behalf of BlueXP as part of managing the local cloud environment. For example, a Connector is can be used to access to one or more Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances.

=== Connector ID

Every Connector is assigned a unique identifier. This value is carried in the HTTP `x-agent-id` request header to identify the request destination.

=== Client ID

In general, a client ID uniquely identifies a client and can be used in several different ways with the BlueXP REST APIs.

Refresh token grant::
When requesting a user access token with the refresh token grant for the SaaS access model, the client ID is constant and represents NetApp BlueXP. The value is always `Mu0V1ywgYteI6w1MbD15fKfVIUrNXGWC`.

Client credentials grant::
When requesting a service token with the client credentials grant, you must retrieve the client ID from the service account through the BlueXP web user interface.

Derive from Connector ID::
You can derive the client ID from the associated Connector ID by simply removing the suffix `clients`. This value is used when accessing the Connector directly (not through the SaaS model).
