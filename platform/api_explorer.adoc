[.lead]
Use the API Explorer feature to execute REST API calls from your browser. The feature is integrated with the Cloud Manager API reference documentation, enabling you to test the various API endpoints while reviewing the documentation.

== Before you begin
There are several things you should consider before using the API Explorer.

==== Prerequisites
You must have a NetApp Cloud Central account with access to Cloud Manager. There might also be additional requirements depending on the API call, such as:

*	agentAuth ID or Connector ID
*	Service account client ID
*	Workspace public ID

You can access these and other values through the Cloud Manager SaaS interface at https://cloudmanager.netapp.com/ and pass them as input parameters to the API calls as needed. See link:platform/get_identifiers.html[Get required identifiers] for more information.

==== Limitations
You can only use the API Explorer to issue REST calls for endpoints that require a user access token. Service tokens and API calls that require a service token are not supported. The Token usage field on the API reference page indicates the type of access token needed for each endpoint. See Key concepts and terminology for more information about access tokens and other important concepts needed when accessing the Cloud Manager resources.

== Issuing a REST API call
