[.lead]
Use the API Explorer feature to execute REST API calls from your browser.

The API explorer feature is integrated with the Cloud Manager API reference documentation, enabling you to test the various API endpoints while reviewing the documentation.

== Before you begin
There are several things you should consider before using the API Explorer.

==== Prerequisites
You must have a NetApp Cloud Central account with access to Cloud Manager.

There might be additional requirements depending on the API call. You might need to retrieve the following identifiers from the link:https://cloudmanager.netapp.com/[Cloud Manager SaaS interface] such as:

*	agentAuth ID or Connector ID
*	Service account client ID
*	Workspace public ID

You can pass them as input parameters to the API calls as needed. See link:get_identifiers.html[Get required identifiers] for more information.

==== Limitation
You can use the API Explorer to issue REST calls for endpoints that require a _user access token_. API calls that require a _service access token_ are not supported.

The _Token usage_ field on the API reference page indicates the type of access token needed for each endpoint. See link:aa_concepts.html[Basic concepts and terminology] to understand the difference between these access tokens and other important concepts when accessing the Cloud Manager resources.

== Issuing a REST API call
The following steps provide an example of how to use the API explorer to issue a typical REST API call.

.Steps

.	Navigate to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-automation/tenancy/post-tenancy-resource-discover.html[Discover an external resource] endpoint in the Tenancy service API documentation.

.	Click *Try it out* to open the API Explorer panel on the right side of the page.
