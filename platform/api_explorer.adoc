[.lead]
The API Explorer is integrated with the BlueXP API reference documentation, enabling you to test the various API endpoints while reviewing the documentation.

NOTE: You can access the API Explorer by clicking *Try it out* on any of the API reference pages where it is supported.

== Before you begin
There are several things you should consider before using the API Explorer.

.Prerequisites
You need to have a NetApp BlueXP account. Refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-netapp-accounts.html[Learn about BlueXP accounts^] for more information.

There might be additional requirements depending on the API call. You might need to obtain the following identifiers from the link:https://console.bluexp.netapp.com/working-environments?view=clouds[BlueXP SaaS interface^]:

*	agentAuth ID or Connector ID
*	Service account client ID
*	Workspace public ID

See link:get_identifiers.html[Get required identifiers] for more information. You can pass the identifiers as input parameters to the API calls as needed.

.Limitations
You can use the API Explorer to issue REST calls for endpoints that require a _user access token_. API calls that require a _service access token_ are not supported.

The _Token usage_ field on an API reference page indicates the type of access token needed for each endpoint. See link:aa_concepts.html[Basic concepts and terminology] to understand the difference between these access tokens and other important concepts when accessing the BlueXP resources.

== Issue a REST API call
The following steps provide an example of how to use the API Explorer to issue a typical REST API call.

.Steps

. Navigate to the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/tenancy/post-tenancy-resource-discover.html[Discover an external resource] endpoint in the Tenancy service API documentation.

. Select *Try it out* to open the API Explorer panel on the right side of the page.
