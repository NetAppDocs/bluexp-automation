There are several workflows you can use to manage the ONTAP on-premises clusters.

[NOTE]
Review the link:prepare.html[Get started] section before using the on-premises ONTAP workflows.

== Workflow categories

The ONTAP on-premises workflows are organized into the following functional categories:

* Working environments
* Aggregates
* Volumes

See link:workflow_processes.html[Understanding the workflow processes] for more information on these categories.

== Connector setup

You can discover and manage on-premises ONTAP clusters with or without a Connector. If you choose to use a Connector, you need to install and deploy the Connector in your cloud provider or your on-premises system. A direct discovery of the on-premises ONTAP clusters is also available through BlueXP; you don't require a Connector for this option. Using a Connector provides you with additional features. See link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-ontap-onprem/task-discovering-ontap.html[Discover on-premises ONTAP clusters^] to learn more about the available options to manage on-premises ONTAP clusters.
