[.lead]
You can use this workflow to create a new SnapMirror replication relationship to an ONTAP working environment. You can replicate data between working environments by choosing a one-time data replication for data transfer, or a recurring schedule for disaster recovery or long-term retention.

[NOTE]
This workflow varies slightly depending on the cloud provider you are using.

=== 1. Select the working environment

Based on the cloud provider, you need to perform a workflow to get the identifier for the working environment as shown in the following table.

|===
|Provider
|Workflow
|AWS
|Perform the workflow link:wf_aws_cloud_get_wes.html[Get working environments] and choose the `publicId` and `svmName` values for the source and destination.
|===

=== 2. Select the LIFs

Perform the workflow link:wf_common_ontap_repl_get_ic_lifs.html[Get intercluster LIFs] and choose the `address` value for the source and destination.

=== 3. Select the SnapMirror policy

Perform the workflow link:wf_common_ontap_md_get_snapmirror_policies.html[Get SnapMirror policies] and choose the `name` value for the required schedule.

=== 4. Select the SnapMirror schedule

Perform the workflow link:wf_common_ontap_repl_get_we_schedules.html[Get schedules] and choose the `name` value for the required policy.

=== 5. Select the volume names and related storage parameters

Based on the cloud provider, you need to perform a workflow to get the volume information.

curl example::
[source,curl]
curl --location --request POST 'https://cloudmanager.cloud.netapp.com/occm/api/replication/vsa' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'x-agent-id: <AGENT_ID>' --header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' --d @JSONinput

Input::

The JSON input example includes the minimum list of input parameters. The `maxTransferRate` is maximum transfer rate limit in KB/s. Specify 0 to indicate no limit or an integer between `1024` and `2,147,482,624`.

JSON input example::
[source,json]
{
  "replicationRequest": {
    "sourceWorkingEnvironmentId": "vsaworkingenvironment-sfrf3wvj",
    "destinationWorkingEnvironmentId": "vsaworkingenvironment-2qkd75xv",
    "sourceInterclusterLifIps": [
      "10.138.0.147"
    ],
    "destinationInterclusterLifIps": [
      "10.138.0.154"
    ],
    "policyName": "MirrorAllSnapshots",
    "scheduleName": "daily",
    "maxTransferRate": 102400
  },
  "replicationVolume": {
    "sourceSvmName": "svm_zivgcp01we02",
    "sourceVolumeName": "zivagg01vol01",
    "destinationVolumeName": "zivagg01vol03_copy",

    "advancedMode": false,
    "destinationProviderVolumeType": "pd-ssd",
    "destinationSvmName": "svm_zivgcp01we03"
  }
}

Output::

None
