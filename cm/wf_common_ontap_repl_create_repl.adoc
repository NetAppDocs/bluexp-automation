[.lead]
You can use this workflow to create a new SnapMirror replication relationship to an ONTAP working environment. You can replicate data between working environments by choosing a one-time data replication for data transfer, or a recurring schedule for disaster recovery or long-term retention.

[NOTE]
This workflow varies slightly depending on the cloud provider you are using.

== Step 1. Select the working environment
Based on the cloud provider, you need to perform the corresponding workflow to retrieve the identifier of the working environment.

[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.AWS
--
Perform the workflow link:wf_aws_cloud_get_wes.html[Get AWS working environments] and choose the `publicId` and `svmName` values for the source and destination.
--
.Azure
--
Perform the workflow link:wf_aws_cloud_get_wes.html[Get Azure working environments] and choose the `publicId` and `svmName` values for the source and destination.
--
.Google Cloud
--
Perform the workflow link:wf_aws_cloud_get_wes.html[Get Google Cloud working environments] and choose the `publicId` and `svmName` values for the source and destination.
--
====

== Step 2. Select the LIFs

Perform the workflow link:wf_common_ontap_repl_get_ic_lifs.html[Get intercluster LIFs] and choose the `address` value for the source and destination.

== Step 3. Select the SnapMirror policy

Perform the workflow link:wf_common_ontap_md_get_snapmirror_policies.html[Get SnapMirror policies] and choose the `name` value for the required schedule.

== Step 4. Select the SnapMirror schedule

Perform the workflow link:wf_common_ontap_repl_get_we_schedules.html[Get schedules] and choose the `name` value for the required policy.

== Step 5. Select the volume names and related storage parameters

Based on the cloud provider, you need to perform the corresponding workflow to retrieve the volume information.

[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.AWS
--
Perform the workflow link:wf_aws_ontap_get_volumes.html[Get AWS volumes] and choose the `name` and `svmName` and `aggregateName` values.
--
.Azure
--
Perform the Azure workflow link:wf_azure_ontap_get_volumes.html[Get Azure volumes] and choose the `name` and `svmName` and `aggregateName` values.
--
.Google cloud
--
Perform the Google Cloud workflow link:wf_gcp_ontap_get_volumes.html[Get Google Cloud volumes] and choose the `name` and `svmName` and `aggregateName` values.
--
====

== Step 6. Create a quote

Based on the cloud provider, you need to perform a workflow to create a volume quote.

[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.AWS
--
Perform the workflow link:wf_aws_ontap_create_quote.html[Create quote] and choose the `providerVolumeType` and `name` values.
--
.Azure
--
Perform the workflow link:wf_azure_ontap_create_quote.html[Create quote] and choose the `providerVolumeType` and `name` values.
--
.Google cloud
--
Perform the workflow link:wf_gcp_ontap_create_quote.html[Create quote] and choose the `providerVolumeType` and `name` values.
--
====

== Step 7. Create the relationship

You can issue the REST API call to create the relationship.

.HTTP method and endpoint

This REST API call uses the following method and endpoint.

[cols="25,75"*,options="header"]
|===
|HTTP method
|Path
|POST
|/occm/api/replication/vsa
|===

.Curl example
[source,curl]
curl --request POST \
--location "https://api.bluexp.netapp.com/occm/api/replication/vsa" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "x-agent-id: <AGENT_ID>" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
--d @JSONinput

.Additional input parameters


The JSON input example includes the minimum list of input parameters. The `maxTransferRate` is maximum transfer rate limit in KB/s. Specify 0 to indicate no limit or an integer between `1024` and `2,147,482,624`.
