[.lead]
You need to prepare before using the REST APIs provided with the ONTAP management service. See the following information for more details. 

.Have BlueXP credentials
You'll need a NetApp account to acquire an access token required to issue the REST API calls.

.Review REST concepts and implementation
Review the link:../platform/http_details.html[REST implementation details] for information about REST concepts and the details of how the REST API is designed.

.Be familiar with Cloud Volumes ONTAP and ONTAP on-premises concepts
If you plan to perform Cloud Volumes ONTAP and on-premises ONTAP administration tasks, you should be familiar with the related ONTAP concepts, terminology, and procedures. Learn about link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/concept-overview-cvo.html[Cloud Volumes ONTAP^] and https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-ontap-onprem/concept-onprem-ontap.html[on-premises ONTAP^]concepts.


.Decide on the cloud provider and have credentials for Cloud Volumes ONTAP
Cloud Volumes ONTAP can be deployed in Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. You need to decide which of these providers you'll use and have the appropriate credentials.

.Decide on the licensing model for Cloud Volumes ONTAP
You can create and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances using a subscription PAYGO ("pay as you go") model or apply your own licenses with BYOL ("bring your own license"). You need to decide which licensing model you'll use and adjust the workflows as needed.

.Prepare to use the workflow processes
Review link:workflow_processes.html[Workflow processes] for more information about the organization and content of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP and on-premises ONTAP workflows. 
[NOTE]
This documentation does not describe or use the legacy UI (not the SaaS UI).

.Locate the identifiers
You'll need the identifier values for several of the workflows. See link:../platform/get_identifiers.html[Get required identifiers] for more information.

.Additional considerations
Review the available resources described in link:../platform/additional_considerations.html[Additional considerations].
